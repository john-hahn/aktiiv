A full-stack web application that allows users to track their workout dates and improve and refine their workouts by searching up exercises that use the body part they want to target. 

This is a personal project I started during my full-stack software developer internship in Summer 2022 at Edovo in order to learn more about full-stack development and apply the skills I was learning during the internship, thus the choice of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

Through this project, I faced challenges in integrating and utilizing an exisiting API and in building a database through the HTML inputs. As a student pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, I realized the coursework in college is very theoretical and does not encompass important topics such as API.
